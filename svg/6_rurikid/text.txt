Within three generations, Ruriks descendants started fighting amongst each other for the power, often looking for backup in Scandinavia. Valedemar Sveinaldsson, who converted to Christianity in 988, got help from Haakon of Norway to overthrow his brother. His son, Jarizleifr, was backed by Anund Jakob of Sweden.

Further fratricidal wars led to the decline of the Rus kingdom which would end with the Mongol invasion of 1240. Later states in the area would claim its heritage, as hinted in names such as Belarus and Russia.
